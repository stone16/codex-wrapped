This project borrows ideas and reference implementations from:

- https://github.com/moddi3/opencode-wrapped (layout and metric inspiration)
- https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage (pricing/data parsing approach, LiteLLM pricing feed)
- codex-summary-template (local template used for layout reference)
